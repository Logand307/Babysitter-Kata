# Project Title
Babysitter-Kata
# Description
This is a command-line application that runs within the terminal. The task is to calculate the nightly wage of a babysitter that gets paid three different wages based on the time of day, and when the children go to bed. Please see breakdown below for specific requirements.

This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night.  The rules are pretty straight forward:

The babysitter 
- starts no earlier than 5:00PM
- leaves no later than 4:00AM
- gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
- gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
- gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
- gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)


Feature:
As a babysitter
In order to get paid for 1 night of work
I want to calculate my nightly charge

# Installation
The node packages utilized within this application are Inquirer and Moment.js. Inquirer is used for user input collection, and Moment.js is used to convert user input to 24 hour time and calculate the wage amount. Jest is also being used for a testing platform. All of these can be installed as dependancies via 'npm install'.
# Usage
The application is initialized by typing 'node index' into the terminal.

Yes - unit testing is done using Jest.
# Future-Development
Upon completion and pass of my test suite, I am receiving a message stating that Jest does not exit one second after the test run has completed. Continuing to troubleshoot.
